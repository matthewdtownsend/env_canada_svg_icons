# env_canada_svg_icons
*Unofficial versions of Environment Canada's weather icons, made for modern displays*


These SVG icons serve as drop-in replacements for [Environment Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change.html)'s low-resolution GIF files. This is not an official project of Environment Canada, and all icons are licensed under CC0.

## Who is this project for?

- Developers leveraging Environment Canada's API to display live weather information in an application. This pairs well with [env_canada](https://github.com/michaeldavie/env_canada), for example.
- Anyone wanting high-resolution versions of Environment Canada's classic weather icon pack (publicatons, graphic designers, etc.)
- Environment Canada

## Features

- 49 SVG icons matching, in filename and style, Environment Canada's low-resolution icon pack
- All icons designed for 512x512 display but, as SVGs, are scalable
- All icons are centred on a square canvas

## Usage

Use the icon code provided by the Environment Canada API to point to the corresponding file.

## About

Made with Inkscape. First developed for [The South Dartmouth Post](https://southdartmouth.ca).
